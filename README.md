# Trajectory Re-Planning With A* Variants

Written in 2008 with an ancient version of
[Processing](http://processing.org), converted to
[Processing.js](http://processingjs.org).

To see it (assuming you have Python installed), [look
here](http://techscursion.com/2015/07/trajectory-replanning.html), or:

1. Clone repo locally.
2. Start basic Python HTTP server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
3. Visit <http://localhost:8000>

It won't work if accessed via a `file://`, Processing.js don't like
it.
