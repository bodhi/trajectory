# Trajectory Re-Planning With A* Variants

Written in 2008 with an ancient version of
[Processing](http://processing.org), converted to
[Processing.js](http://processingjs.org).

To view (assuming you have Python installed):

1. Clone repo locally.
2. Start basic Python HTTP server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
3. Visit <http://localhost:8000>

It won't work if accessed via a `file://`, Processing.js don't like
it.
